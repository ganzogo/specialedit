# Description:
#   jQuery plugin that adds buttons to text input fields which allow the user
#   to easily enter special characters.
# 
#   If you are creating a form to be completed in a language that is not
#   necessarily the user's first language, they will likely have to use the
#   Character Map program if they are using Windows, or the equivalent in their
#   operating system. This is a tiresome user experience. Much better to give
#   them buttons to quickly input special characters.
#
#   This plugin is particularly useful for things like language learning sites,
#   translation sites, etc.... Any situation where you don't expect your users
#   to have the hardware to easily enter special characters.
#
#   Compatible with jQuery >= 1.2.4
